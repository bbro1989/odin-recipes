    <p>
        Cupcakes are small, individually-sized cakes that are baked in muffin tins and often topped with frosting. They come in countless flavors and styles, making them a fun and versatile dessert for birthdays, parties, or everyday treats.<br> Their size makes them easy to serve and enjoy without utensils, and they can be decorated creatively with sprinkles, fruit, or themed toppers.
    </p>
    <p>
        While vanilla and chocolate are classic cupcake flavors, bakers often experiment with fillings, such as jam or cream, and frostings like buttercream or cream cheese icing.<br> Cupcakes are beloved for their soft, moist texture and their ability to be customized to suit any occasion or personal taste.
